# Resolved Quirks & Tech Debt

Entries that used to live in [known_quirks.md](known_quirks.md) and are **fixed now**. They are
kept for history: what the problem was, how it bit you, and how it was solved — that is why the
code looks the way it does today. Only *open* oddities belong in
[known_quirks.md](known_quirks.md).

Original entry numbers are kept ("former #8") so old references and commits still make sense.
Index of all docs: [README.md](README.md).

## Resolved correctness issues

### Former #8 — Default-tag assignment crashed on tagless universes (fixed)

**Then:** `CharactersController#create` (and the location/item equivalents) did
`...character_tags.order(:id).first.id if ids.empty?` — a `NoMethodError` on `nil` when the
universe had no tags yet (tag fixtures/seeds normally prevented this), and it force-tagged
records the user had deliberately left untagged. `SectionsController#create` used
`Story#default_section_tag`, which lazily created a tag named *"Section"*.

**Fix:** tags became optional on every content model, so all default-tag fallbacks were removed
and `Story#default_section_tag` was deleted as dead code. Creating a record without tags simply
saves it untagged — a tagless universe (or story) is now a normal state, not a crash.

### Former #21 — Universes could be saved without a name (fixed)

**Then:** `Universe` had no validations, so a missing or blank name passed validation even
though other named records rejected it.

**Fix:** `Universe` now validates that `name` is present. Model and request tests cover the
validation and reject universe creation without a name; the existing form error handling renders
the validation message.

### Former #24 — Deleting a section tag silently un-tagged its sections (fixed, in two steps)

**Then:** section tags were universe-wide while sections were story-scoped, so a tag could be
deleted even though stories still referenced it.

**Fix, step 1 (scoping):** tags belong to a story — migration
`db/migrate/20260923120000_move_section_tags_to_stories.rb`, plus a `Section` validation that
all `section_tags` share the section's story. A tag can no longer be deleted from under
*another* story.

**What remained:** deleting a tag still dropped the join rows of its own story, and the
affected sections only noticed at their **next save** (`section_tags` presence validation) —
a deferred, silent failure. The same applied to every tag model (character/location/item/event/
relation/ownership tags).

**Fix, step 2 (no presence validation):** `HasManyTags` no longer adds
`validates association, presence: true`, so tags are optional on **every** content model.
Deleting a tag simply leaves its records untagged, which is valid — no deferred failure, nothing
breaks at the next save, and no controller force-assigns a default tag to compensate
(see former #8).
